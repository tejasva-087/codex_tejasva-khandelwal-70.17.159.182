# First hackathon at VIT Bhopal university

Briefly, I will explain what the hackathon was all about. It was a frontend and marketing hackathon consisting of three rounds:
Round 1: UI Replication using HTML, CSS and JS only (1hr 20min)
Round 2: Creating a webpage promoting a product from Cisco Company based on a given theme (2hrs)
Round 3: Create a marketing strategy presentation for the chosen product and pitch it in 3 minutes (45min)

Getting through the first round was very easy for us, we were the first ones to complete the task and some cisco community members were really impressed by us.
After going to the second round we battled against time and give our 100% and created a basic website for the given product.
I used HTML, CSS and SASS to create the website. After going through the sites created by other's, made me realize how different technologies like the Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap can help save a lot of time and increase productivity. I will definitely learn those skills, practice them and never give up.
Even though we didn't got selected for the third round we gave our best and I am very happy I took part in this hackathon.
